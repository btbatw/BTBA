            We are very pleased that after BTBA, our colleagues and friends decided to establish their local Taiwanese Biotechnology Associations (TBA). Currently, we have several fellow TBA organizations around the world. BTBA and other TBAs share many events regularly through the web and are looking forward to co-organizing an International TBA event in the future.
